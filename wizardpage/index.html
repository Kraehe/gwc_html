        <a href="https://www.google.com">This link</a> leads to an interesting website called <b>Google</b>.
        Google allows people such as yourselves to search for <i>anything</i> you can possibly think of.
        It’s one of the most magical websites that exist in our society today.
        Make sure to click this link and give me money—
        I mean, click the link and search for your heart’s true desire!

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com">This link</a> is a gate to another relatively enchanting website.
        It’s called… <b>YouTube</b>. You can look at thousands of videos, whether useless, entertaining, or educational.
        It’s similar to Google in the sense that it’s owned by the same company and you can search for pretty much anything.
        <i>Beware of the comment sections</i>, and don’t forget to subscribe to my channel and hit the like button on <i>all</i> of my videos.

        <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/">This website</a> is a <i>fabulous</i> one. <b>Dungeons and Dragons</b> is a great resource for creating your own worlds and stories, but it's also fun to immerse others into them as well.
        You can lead relatively normal lives, or you can go all out and become a fantasy creature, battle dragons, steal things from dark and mysterious caves,
        rob wizards, <i>take your wife to court in order to fight for custody over your children</i>… normal things like that. For more information about this game, refer to <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/dungeons-and-dragons/what-is-dd">this page</a> to get a better background.
